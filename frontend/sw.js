/* ── Fetch: cache-first only for the known static app-shell assets;

   Previously this used a blocklist of known backend path prefixes
   (/auth/, /deep-analysis, etc.) and cache-first'd anything that didn't
   match. That list didn't cover every backend route: endpoints like
   /projects, /messages, /conversations, /notifications, and /jobs (which
   pass the session token as a query parameter, per this app's auth
   convention) fell through to the cache-first branch, so their
   responses, and the token embedded in the cached request URL, were
   written to Cache Storage and persisted after logout.

   Flipping to an allowlist of the precached shell files removes that
   gap: only files this service worker explicitly precached (or a
   handful of common static-asset extensions) are ever cache-first'd or
   written to the cache. Every other same-origin or cross-origin
   request, including any current or future backend route, goes
   straight to the network and is never cached. */
